  Data visualizations are a primary tool for communicating statistical results, leveraging
  our extremely high visual bandwidth to make working with and thinking about data more efficient.
  In statistics, we often need to visualize data with its associated uncertainty, 
  which requires rethinking standard graphical approaches to incorporate this 
  additional dimension of information (or lack thereof). 
  In this introductory overview, we will discuss different ways to visualize
  uncertainty, along with the perceptual challenges that accompany each method, 
  with the goal of identifying uncertainty visualizations that are both perceptually effective
  and statistically meaningful.
