  Statisticians and data scientists spend a lot of time making things computer-readable -- 
  cleaning data, ensuring code is efficient, and producing outputs in the "right" format. 
  The most important steps in a data analysis, though, often involve the transition between
  human and computer at either end of the data science pipeline. It's important to understand
  how humans think about problems or make judgments subjectively, and it's important to leverage
  that information to understand how best to communicate statistical results back to people.
  In this talk, I'll discuss a series of problems that lie at this interface between humans,
  computers, data, and statistical algorithms, and emphasize the importance of these problems
  to society.
