::: {.notes}

In the past 20 years, CSI-style forensic analysis has taken quite a beating. 

DNA is the gold standard for forensic evidence - a specific combination of genes is supposed to be unique to the individual, matches can be objectively determined with error rates that are quantifiable, and it could be used to reexamine evidence from old cases.

As organizations like the Innocence Project used DNA to revisit old cases, it became clear that there were *major* problems with the evidence used in criminal cases -- eyewitness testimony, false confessions, and shoddy forensics. 

There were a number of very embarrassing cases where forensic evidence was shown to be faulty.
As these cases happened, scientists started asking how this all went so wrong? Wasn't forensics ultimately based in science? Weren't there studies out there showing that forensic techniques had low error rates?
