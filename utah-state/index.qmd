::: {.notes}

In the past 20 years, CSI-style forensic analysis has taken quite a beating. 

DNA is the gold standard for forensic evidence - a specific combination of genes is supposed to be unique to the individual, matches can be objectively determined with error rates that are quantifiable, and it could be used to reexamine evidence from old cases.

As organizations like the Innocence Project used DNA to revisit old cases, it became clear that there were *major* problems with the evidence used in criminal cases -- eyewitness testimony, false confessions, and shoddy forensics. 

There were a number of very embarrassing cases where forensic evidence was shown to be faulty.
As these cases happened, scientists started asking how this all went so wrong? Wasn't forensics ultimately based in science? Weren't there studies out there showing that forensic techniques had low error rates?

> O’Neil was asked specifically at trial what he meant by the phrase “to the exclusion of any other tool.”
> “That the individual jaw, the location within that jaw on that particular side, was identified as having cut the wire in question to a degree of certainty to exclude any other tool,” he said, according to court transcripts referenced in Gurley’s decision.
> O’Neil said this was **true of needle-nosed pliers used on the bomb, slip-joint pliers, as well as the wire cutter**.

## Personal Motivation

![My house has $\approx$ 982 cm of (easily accessible) blade surface which might be used to cut wires. My dad has $\approx$ 2243 cm of blade surface in his shop. No one in either location is a craftsperson.](../images/Shop-annotated.png){fig-alt="An annotated picture of a messy garage, showing all of the tools which could conceivably make striated toolmarks, including visegrips, pliers, bolt cutters, pry bars, electrical tools, razor blades, hammers, tin snips, saws, and more." width="100%"}

## Constructive Scientific Proof<br>[from first principles]{.emph .meddarkblue .smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column .r-fit-text width="70%"}
- Understand 
    - how tools make marks
    - tool wear over time
    - tool manufacturing processes
    - tool/material interaction
    - mark type/frequency distribution
- Track
    - Frequency of tools in a local population

::: {.notes}

Scientifically, we might boil this down to a series of engineering and materials science problems - understanding the types of marks which can occur on different types of tool materials through manufacture, wear, etc., and then understanding in turn how those tools transfer marks to other surfaces and how force, angle, and material hardness impact those marks. 

Unfortunately, though, the number of different characteristics gets very quickly out of control and you end up with an exponential number of interactions very quickly. 

Establishing the discipline from first principles is ... difficult, to say the least. You could probably do it with a combination of time, stubbornness, and statistical inference, but there is always a chance that a new manufacturing method will be developed that will produce new types/classes of markings. 

But, there are other ways to handle this problem. 
:::


## 📐 A Different Angle on the Problem

- $e^{(1)}$: error rate for a single comparison
- $e^{(N)}$: overall error rate, $N$ comparisons

- Calculate $N$: \# comparisons between tool and evidence

- [Ultimate question]{.emph .darkpurple}:     
What does $e^{(1)}$ need to be for $e^{(N)}$ to be low^[Low enough will be determined by courts⚖️, not statisticians... 🫣]?


## Wire Cuts

## Structural Parameters

![](../images/Surface_Counts.png){fig-alt="A profile image of the blades of each of four types of tools - wedge-type cuts (guillotine/wire cutters), scissors, pliers, and blades. All but pliers have two cutting surfaces, but the angles of each surface differ. Pliers have 4 cutting surfaces." width="80%" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"}


- Bladed Surfaces: $s \in \{2, 4\}, 1 \leq i \leq s$

- Cut Surfaces (on one wire): $w \in \{1, 2\}, 1\leq j\leq w$



## Visual Examination


::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}
- Test cuts made along the blade(s) of the tool

- At least $N_{ij} = b_i/d_j$ comparisons for each blade surface $i$ and cut wire surface $j$

- Manual alignment: estimate the minimum comparisons

![](../images/number of comparisons.svg){width="100%" fig-alt="A diagram showing a blade cut (long, thin) with striations compared to a wire cut (semi-circle shape, short) aligned with the blade cut.

## Visual Examination



![](../images/number of comparisons.svg){width="100%" fig-alt="A diagram showing a blade cut (long, thin) with striations compared to a wire cut (semi-circle shape, short) aligned with the blade cut. There are multiple non-overlapping positions along the blade cut where the wire cut could fit, and each is shown with an empty hemisphere." style="position:absolute;top:40%;left:20px;"}

Adj. comparisons are non-overlapping $\Rightarrow$ "independent"^[There are peak-valley dependence structures in profile data, but conditioning on tool/material/manufacturing, we would **expect** statistical independence between adjacent comparisons]


## Algorithmic Comparison

Scans -> Cross Section -> "Signature"    
(remove gross topology)

![Cross-correlation is used to align signature from blade cut surface to signature from wire cut surface. Image credit: Heike Hofmann](../images/alignment-crop-sm.gif){fig-alt="An animated gif of a wire cross-section sliding along a composite cross section generated from a blade cut."}



## Number of Comparisons

```{r}
nc <- floor(15000/0.645 - 2000/0.645 + 1)
Ncomp1 <- format(nc, big.mark=",")
Ncomp2 <- format(nc*2, big.mark=",")
```

 &nbsp;           | Minimum (Manual) | Maximum (Algorithm)
----------------- | ----------- | ------------------
blade size        | $b=15 \text{mm}$   | $b=15000 \mu \text{m}$
cutting surfaces  | $s=2$/blade | $s=2$/blade
wire size         | $d=2 \text{mm}$    | $d=2000 \mu \text{m}$
wire surface      | $w=1$       | $w=1$
resolution        |             | $r=0.645 \mu \text{m/px}$
\# per side       | 7.5         | `{r} Ncomp1`
\# total          | 15          | `{r} Ncomp2`


This assumes a single wire and a single possible tool.


## So How Bad Is the Problem?

For error rate $e$ and $n$ comparisons

$$P(\text{no false positive errors}) = 1 - \left(1 - e\right)^n$$ 

::: fragment

[Simple probability 🎲 strikes again!]{.emph .darkcerulean}

:::

## So How Bad Is the Problem?

- Estimated false positive error rate for striated comparisons from bullets and firing pins: 0.45 - 7.24%. 

  - [**Pooled estimate**: 2%]{.emph .darkgreen}

  - Not enough error rate studies on wires
  - Bullets have additional structure to facilitate alignment
  - Wires have additional complexity 
      - shorter sequences
      - more dependence on angle

[$\Rightarrow$ **2% is a generous estimate...**]{.emph .meddarkblue .fragment}

## So How Bad Is the Problem?

To keep the overall false positive rate under 10%...

![](../images/table-fpr-family.png){fig-alt="A table showing the family wise false discovery rate for N comparisons using several different estimates of striated comparison error rates. When the FDR is 7%, over 50% of 10-comparison samples would be expected to have a false positive. When the FDR is 2%, over 18% of 10-comparison samples would be expected to have a false positive. Additional columns are provided giving the expected frequency of 100 and 1000 comparisons under different error rates. The final column provides the maximum number of comparisons at the specified error rate which can be performed to keep the family wise false positive error rate under 10%."}

[2% Error -> 5 total comparisons.]{.emph .meddarkblue .fragment}

[Minimum of 15 required to do even a simple wire-cut analysis.]{.emph .meddarkblue .fragment}

## Conclusions

- Wire cut forensics are not scientifically sound using current analysis methods

::: fragment

but... this problem shows up in database searches, too!

- IAFIS (Integrated Automated Fingerprint ID System)
- NIBIN (Ballistics Database)
- NDIS (National DNA ID System) and CODIS (Combined DNA ID System)
- PDQ (Paint Data Query)
- FISH (Forensic ID System for Handwriting)

:::

## Conclusions

::: incremental
- Automatic intelligence algorithms are not a good substitute for investigative work

- Example: Oregon
  - 3 firearms examiners for the state
  - Most firearms evidence run through NIBIN first
  - Promising leads forwarded to examiners for manual assessment
  
:::

[This is a setup that could generate false-positives by design!]{.cerulean .emph .fragment}

## Conclusions

::: incremental

- Examiners should report and the defense should require

  - [overall length/area of surfaces generated during the examination $(b)$]{.small}
  - [total consecutive length/area of recovered evidence $(d)$]{.small}


- Studies relating length/area of comparison surface to error rates are essential!

  - [No available black-box error rate for wire cuts]{.small}
  - [Studies should be difficult, like casework!]{.small}
