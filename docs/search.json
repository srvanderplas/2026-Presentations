As these cases happened, scientists started asking how this all went so wrong? Wasn’t forensics ultimately based in science? Weren’t there studies out there showing that forensic techniques had low error rates?"

You could probably do it with a combination of time, stubbornness, and statistical inference, but there is always a chance that a new manufacturing method will be developed that will produce new types/classes of markings.\nBut, there are other ways to handle this problem."
